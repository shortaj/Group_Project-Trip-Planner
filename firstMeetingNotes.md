#What we discussed on Nov 3rd

Wireframes are attached (see repo files).

##Possible questions/options:
* When would you like to go? (time of year, seasons)
* Languages spoken at destination
* Expense level $0 - $1,000, unlimited
* Occasion (anniversary, family trip, etc.)
* Adventure (beach, sports(whether they follow any), historical stuff)

In our destination objects we will include cities, not just countries, as there may be completely different experiences within the same country.

##Will research (by Monday?)
**Ashley:** Asia/Australia
**Anna:** Europe
**Alex:** Southern/warm countries, US

(We haven't discussed how many each. However many we find that are interesting enough?)

We will decide on particular properties and number of them after some research.
Also, will discuss whether we'll use Trello or Waffle later, after looking more into benefits of each one.

Changes? Corrections? Please add.
